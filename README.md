# United-Cloud-Test
Technical test for United Cloud

Greetings and thank you for using my tests for basic profile functions for EON application.


This serie of tests is used to show functionalityes for creating and deleting new profiles, and also error checking for invalid input for user's years

All tests are in one file "TestLogin.class". You can run test separatly, by right-clicking on the body of the test you want to run, and selecting option "Run '$TEST_NAME$'".If you want to run all of the tests at once, right-click on the body of the class and click on "Run '$FILE_NAME$'"



Second part of the test with databases is done using online compiler, so you can check for the code functionality directly online.
Just choose the querry you wish to test, and delete  /* before the querry, and \*/ after the querry.
